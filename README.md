# Math-for-Machine-Learning-Project
This was the my course project for MAP4112 - Math for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Here, I developed the code to perform classification on the quality of wine. I used linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, and support vector machines. Each model then predicted the quality score of wine ranging from 3-9.
